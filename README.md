# GRITS_Code_2022

## Overview
This repository contains the codebase developed by **The Flying Legion**, a high school FRC Robotics team, for the **2022 GRITS (Georgia Robotics Invitational Tournament and Showcase)** event. This year marked a significant milestone for our team as we transitioned from LabVIEW to Java, enabling more robust and efficient implementation of our robot's functionality.

Our code controlled **Mantis**, the robot we designed and built for the 2022 FRC competition season. This was the first year we fully adopted Java as our primary programming language, taking advantage of its flexibility, scalability, and better integration with modern development tools.

## Robot Capabilities
**Mantis** was programmed with five primary functionalities:

1. **Elevator Control**: Operates the robot's elevator system for precise vertical movements.
2. **Shooter Mechanism**: Controls the shooter for accurate launching of game pieces.
3. **Intake System**: Handles the collection of game elements on the field.
4. **Intake Holder Movement**: Adjusts the position of the intake for effective game play.
5. **Drive Train**: Implements smooth and responsive robot navigation using a differential drive system.

## Why Java?
In previous years, our team relied on LabVIEW for robot programming. While LabVIEW offered a visual approach to programming, it had its limitations in terms of scalability, version control, and collaborative development. By switching to Java, we gained several advantages:

- **Code Modularity**: Java allowed us to write reusable, organized, and modular code.
- **Collaboration**: Integration with GitHub enabled better version control and teamwork.
- **Advanced Tools**: Access to powerful development tools like WPILib and Visual Studio Code.
- **Performance**: More efficient execution of complex robot logic and algorithms.
- **Learning Opportunities**: Provided team members with skills relevant to professional software development.

## Features
### Autonomous Mode
- **One-Ball Auto**: Starts with one ball, collects another, and shoots with precision timing.
- **Two-Ball Auto**: Preloaded with two balls, drives to specific locations, and shoots strategically.

### Teleoperated Mode
- **Manual Control**: Full operator control over all robot systems.
- **Turbo Mode**: Optional speed boost for quicker navigation.
- **Shooter and Elevator**: Adjustable settings for optimal game strategy.
- **Safety Features**: Integrated limit switches to prevent hardware overdrive.

### Additional Features
- **Camera Integration**: Live video feed from USB cameras to enhance driver visibility.
- **Lighting Control**: Red/blue LED lights controlled via pneumatics for signaling.
- **Pneumatic System**: Arm movement and intake mechanisms powered by pneumatic actuators.
